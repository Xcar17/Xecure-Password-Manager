The initial setup of the application consists of adding the username and password of your MYSQL database. To do this user’s need to edit the database.py file and add their username on line four, and then the password on line five. For more details, please see the example below:

	Line 4:  'user': 'root',
    	Line 5:  'passwd': '12345',
	Note: Replace “root” with your username and “12345” with your password.

After adding the username and password to the “database.py” file, the application is ready for use. To run the application users, must run the “main.py” file. This will create the MYSQL database and start the Xecure Password Manager Application.
